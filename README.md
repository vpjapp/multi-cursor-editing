# Multi-Cursor Editing practicing material

In this repo there are around 13 scenarios which which you can practice multi-cursor editing.

Each scenario is in it's own directory. The `source.*` file contains the starting point instructions and the `target.*` contains the wanted result.

Try and use multiple cursors to get from the source to the target.

Good luck!
